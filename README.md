Your job is to create a simple web application (react-typescript using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>), which visualizes the API data of <a href="https://swapi.dev/"> SWAPI</a>. Just be creative and invest as much time as you want. One way might be to start with a list of movies, and then navigate your way down via characters or other entities. You do not have to use all the resources the API is offering you, but there should be at least one or two layers of master-detail relationship.
